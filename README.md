## Inspiration

Significant pain points relating to friendships are faced by many: 

47% of people report having lost touch with friends in the past 12 months.  

When feeling lonely & disconnected, we instinctively protect ourselves by avoiding reaching out to others.  

A psychological study shows that many of us have little knowledge about our friends, leading to frustrating relationships. 

However: 

One of the best ways to get to know someone is to have conversations and ask questions. 

Connecting with others is one of life’s necessities, starting a biochemical reaction of positive hormones and neurotransmitters.  

Sharing details of your life and listening can create emotional bonds, allowing others to feel seen, understood, and supported. 

## What it does
Impromptu is a mobile app that prompts you to answer curated, engaging questions at randomly selected times of the day. Questions can range from lighthearted funny moments, deeper get-to-know questions, to fun facts and experiences. 

Questions are relevant to the time of the day, for example: 

9:00AM: What did you dream about last night?  

12:00PM: Take a photo of your lunch.

Answer your question to be able to see your friends' responses! Share your experiences, learn more about each other, and stay connected day-to-day with your friends— Impromptu does it all for you, without you having to reach out. Never miss a day to garner an answering streak! 

Users can also foster interaction by commenting on each others' responses. The user profile will display a consolidated view of your responses over time, allowing you to reflect on your past memories. 

## How we built it
The UI/UX was prototyped using Figma and implemented with React Native. We used NoSQL's database, Firebase for the backend to store and retrieve user information.

## Challenges we ran into
- Many members of our team are more familiar with front-end development so for many of us, this was one first times using Firebase. We faced many difficulties, from setting it up to connecting it with the frontend.
- Ideating: Our team were able to brainstorm many ideas, but none felt like they were "it." We would discuss and our ideas would be overflowing, to the point where we had to narrow back down as they were unrealistic to complete in a 24 hour hackathon. 
- We drove from Seattle from Vancouver (UBC) so we struggled with getting enough sleep, having a proper place to rest, and being mindful of staying well-rested for the 3 hour car ride back tomorrow. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating an engaging, fully functioning full-stack application. The app idea is simple, yet effective, and leaves lots of room for future growth. Our UI/UX is fun, bright, and appealing to users. 

## What we learned
We learned that Yerba Mate is actually really good— the mint flavour is the best one. 

## What's next for Impromptu
In the future, we can allow friends chat with each other through direct message to further foster the social interaction aspect. We will be continuously expanding our selection of questions, possibly using AI to generate questions more relevant to the user's location, timezone, or other factors.
